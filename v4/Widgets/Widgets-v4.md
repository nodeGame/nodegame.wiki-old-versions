Widgets are reusable user interface components that can be loaded
dynamically in a nodeGame game. They serve multiple purposes. For
example, they can display the values of internal timer objects, the
number of remaining rounds in a stage, the amount of monetary rewards
gained by a player so far, etc. They can also offer a chat window to
communicate between experimenter and participants, or simply display
debugging information during the development and testing of the
experiment.
